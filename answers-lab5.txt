1. Do you have to do anything else to ensure that this I/O privilege setting is saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch from one environment to another? Why?

No.  Here we are setting the privilege at env creation in the kernel.  When you switch from one environment to another, we should be saving things to the trapframe (EFLAGS register).  This way, we shouldn't have to do anything else to insure the I/O privilege setting is saved.
